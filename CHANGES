   - Minor change (reader might not want to see it)
   * Major change (reader probably wants to see it)
   ! Breaking change (reader should be alarmed & afraid)

   add section name if you feel like it
   - bah
   - buh
   * bah buh.
   ! beep beep. Deprecation soon

   use whatever case, tense you like.  just make sure each line is:
     = within 76 columns @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
     = preferably 72     @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
   try not to edit old typos, unless it is misleading, because like,
   i still want git-blame(1) to work y'know.... so just don't :)

   [[ for that reason you also do not need to add your name; just
      make sure your git is well-fed and configured correctly! ]]

   [[ if we end up not versioning, just the date alone is fine. ]]
   [[ however, if we do version, developer releases should have an
      UNDERSCORE per the tradition of Perl programs.  beyond that,
      just use whatever number your heart desires. :)  try to make
      them follow lexicographical order though, as it can be a pain
      to have to manually sort git-tag(1) output. :# ]]
