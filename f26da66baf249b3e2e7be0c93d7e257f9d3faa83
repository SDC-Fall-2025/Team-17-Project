Even Codeberg has no problem with it!!!

But okay, seriously, @EOF is going to ping some rando again
thanks to this Twitter-pomelo username of a disaster... but
i have no intention of changing that because my commits have
been made and i have more important things to focus on than
going back and re-signing all of this just to avoid some plat-
form i am only going to stay on for the time being.  (and yes,
CodeBerg... i am a little disappointed that even you are like
this too.  but what can i say, sigh....)
