ok.....

$ env TERM=dumb ex pnpm-workspace.yaml
"pnpm-workspace.yaml" 2 lines, 35 characters
:set number
:%p
     1  onlyBuiltDependencies:
     2    - esbuild

let's just add something to it i guess

:1i
     1  packages:
  - .     2
     3  .
:%p
     1  packages:
     2    - .
     3  onlyBuiltDependencies:
     4    - esbuild
:wq
"pnpm-workspace.yaml" 4 lines, 51 characters

hope that this would work
