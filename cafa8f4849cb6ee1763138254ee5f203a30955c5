This is both *my* pull request (and a pull request example,
for familiarizing people with the protocol!)

Pull requests are always optional for any changes you make.
But if you *do* decide to open a pull request, be prepared to
write a summary (cover letter) like this & receive feedback...

- [x] I have checked that my name and e-mail address are consistently reflected in all commits.
- [x] I have reviewed that all GPG signatures are valid and match my GitHub identity (possibly vacuously so).

(This checklist should be provided to you in the [PR template][];
if not, please do me a favor and prepend it to your PR body.
It is not reinforced if you submit patches through the mailing list.)

# Cover letter

On Thursday, October 16, we had our first meeting about our team project,
where we had the first formal discussion regarding the project we want to
work on as a team. [1]  The consensus among those who attended was a club
discovery service, dubbed "Club Radar" by me (mostly humorously). [2]
The official-ish meeting notes were subsequently published by me on the
morning of October 22 for those who could not attend the meeting.

On Thursday, October 23, I opened a Discord poll in hopes of giving those
who could not attend a choice to voice their project preference [3]
(and a chance to propose their projects, which I forgot to add a poll
option for or state that very clearly... sorry if you had ideas but didn't
share them because you believed you couldn't propose any more then. :x)
Among the five participants who voted (excluding me, since I am neutral
about this XD), both "Club Radar" and "Minecraft with Computer Vision"
received the maximum number of votes from 3 distinct sets of team members
(albeit not mutually disjoint since I intentionally made it so that each
participant can vote on more than one project).

Despite the obvious (in hindsight at least) winner of "Club Radar" out of
*both* elections, I tactlessly decided that we needed one more *final* in-
person meeting to settle the tie, once and for all.

By October 29, two weeks have passed since our first meeting, and the
official team leader did not publish any plans for a second meeting.
I urged the leader to consider a second meeting, but the leader only
responded with a When2Meet.  As of me writing this (November 6, 10 AM),
only 3 members (including me) have filled out their time preference.

On October 31, I informally stated that the project decision will be
loosely finalized if any member chooses to contribute a non-negligible
amount of code. [4]  As of me writing this, no one has pushed any code
to any Branch of Interest-worthy Project (bip/*), despite most members
having push access to this repository.

By 10 AM on the same day, I myself have contributed a non-negligible
amount (at least in my consideration) in an effort to deploy the web
site's backend and frontend components to Vercel (see shortlog below).

On November 4, I informally stated that the project decision will be
passively finalized if NO member expresses a will that overrides mine.

Today is November 6 and this will be the FORMAL statement that our
team project will be this club discovery web site dubbed Club Radar.
