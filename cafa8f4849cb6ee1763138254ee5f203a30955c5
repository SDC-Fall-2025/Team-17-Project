This is both *my* pull request (and a pull request example,
for familiarizing people with the protocol!)

Pull requests are always optional for any changes you make.
But if you *do* decide to open a pull request, be prepared to
write a summary (cover letter) like this & receive feedback...

- [x] I have checked that my name and e-mail address are consistently reflected in all commits.
- [x] I have reviewed that all GPG signatures are valid and match my GitHub identity (possibly vacuously so).

(This checklist should be provided to you in the [PR template][];
if not, please do me a favor and prepend it to your PR body.
It is not reinforced if you submit patches through the mailing list.)

# Cover letter

On Thursday, October 16, we had our first meeting about our team project,
where we had the first formal discussion regarding the project we want to
work on as a team. [1]  The consensus among those who attended was a club
discovery service, dubbed "Club Radar" by me (mostly humorously). [2]
The official-ish meeting notes were subsequently published by me on the
morning of October 22 for those who could not attend the meeting.

On Thursday, October 23, I opened a Discord poll in hopes of giving those
who could not attend a choice to voice their project preference [3]
(and a chance to propose their projects, which I forgot to add a poll
option for or state that very clearly... sorry if you had ideas but didn't
share them because you believed you couldn't propose any more then. :x)
Among the five participants who voted (excluding me, since I am neutral
about this XD), both "Club Radar" and "Minecraft with Computer Vision"
received the maximum number of votes from 3 distinct sets of team members
(albeit not mutually disjoint since I intentionally made it so that each
participant can vote on more than one project).

Despite the obvious (in hindsight at least) winner of "Club Radar" out of
*both* elections, I tactlessly decided that we needed one more *final* in-
person meeting to settle the tie, once and for all.

By October 29, two weeks have passed since our first meeting, and the
official team leader did not publish any plans for a second meeting.
I urged the leader to consider a second meeting, but the leader only
responded with a When2Meet.  As of me writing this (November 6, 10 AM),
only 3 members (including me) have filled out their time preference.

On October 31, I informally stated that the project decision will be
loosely finalized if any member chooses to contribute a non-negligible
amount of code. [4]  As of me writing this, no one has pushed any code
to any Branch of Interest-worthy Project (bip/*), despite most members
having push access to this repository.

By 10 AM on the same day, I myself have contributed a non-negligible
amount (at least in my consideration) in an effort to deploy the web
site's backend and frontend components to Vercel (see shortlog below).

On November 4, I informally stated that the project decision will be
passively finalized if NO member expresses a will that overrides mine.

Today is November 6 and this will be the FORMAL statement that our
team project will be this club discovery web site dubbed Club Radar.

#     add even more exhaustive Mac OS + Windows ignores
#     
#     i guess i don't blame people as much.... researching
#     this list alone and trying to get a grasp of why apple
#     made these choices is a pure headache @_@
#     
#     like i tried to get a hold of why Mac OS named this peculiar
#     file "Icon\r" - like i know .DS_Store = Desktop Services Store,
#     .Spotlight is the Cmd+Space spotlight search cache, all of
#     these had (somewhat) logical names and, more importantly, start
#     with a dot like the rest of Unix descendents do.  But at SOME
#     point of time, Mac OS wasn't Unix-based as it has been since OS X
#     (with an XNU (unrelated to GNU) kernel and a FreeBSD userspace)
#     and did things its own way such as using CR as the line delimiter.
#     
#     The relevance of this information is that "Icon\r" ends with
#     ** that very same CR. **  So SOMEONE (namely GPT) says that
#     "Icon\r" was named that way because it was (classic) Mac OS's
#     way of hiding a file (before adopting the Unix convention of
#     using dot-files that is).  But, being unable to re-produce the
#     result on my MacBook Finder ("Icon\r" always shows up as "Icon?"
#     which isn't even a special character for "\r"; "Icon\n" shows
#     the same), i cannot say i am ready to believe that was the case.
#     
#     the more compelling reason was that "Icon\r" was only a link to
#     something else called Resource Fork which is FAR past the scope
#     of this discussion.  either way, the links are there.... maybe
#     they could be of use, maybe not?  or maybe i forgot if anyone on
#     the team even uses a MacBook.  eh. :v
#     
#     (I think I can name at least one person that uses Mac in my head
#     so all of this shouldn't be a complete waste of time.)
