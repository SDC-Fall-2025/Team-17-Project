Welcome to the team!!!

I am not your leader today, but I hope y'all are still with me...

   * Add your changes in CHANGES.  (Copy the example.)
   * If you contribute, your name goes into THANKS
     and you get a virtual Cookie! :P

   ***>>> Once we decide on a project, put the specs in here,
          and create an INSTALL file (with NO file extension)
          for detailed installation/deployment process.

Remember to WRAP your lines at column 72/76/80 so that the text
looks good IRRESPECTIVE of any fancy IDE or Gitweb code browser.

Hack away! ~ethan
