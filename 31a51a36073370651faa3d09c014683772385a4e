the last time i saved this files was roughly when i knew
i needed a build system JUST for me; a dependency graph,
a content-addressable protocol neutral URI schema; and a
site manifest + metadata store.... i completed the first of
the three of these while having the whole thing planned out
in a very, VERY promising way.  like i wish i was bluffing
but oh my gosh i think this would ACTUALLY work this time
i'm so happyyyyyy :DDDD
