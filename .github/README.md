# Club Radar

This is the `bip/club-radar` branch.  The "bip" stands for "Branch of
Interest-worthy Project".  Club Radar received the most votes as of Monday
at 3 votes!  The runner-ups were "Minecraft with Computer Vision" and
"Task Manager".

Merge this branch into master if we ultimately decide to go for this project.

## Software Stack

It looks like we are going with SvelteKit above all else...
(but is a separate backend really necessary?)  Either way, since
I am definitely not paying anything out of my pocket for this,
we are going with the only options that can be hosted on Vercel
(between Flask and FastAPI that is.)
