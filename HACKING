   * Add your changes in CHANGES.  (Copy the example.)

          and create an INSTALL file (with NO file extension)
          for detailed installation/deployment process.

       [[ If the Club permits and everyone is fine with it, we

*** Setup for Task Manager

Task Manager is an Android application.  The programming language
we will use is Kotlin, which like Java can be compiled into JVM
bytecode.  So even if Kotlin may look wildly different from Java
on the surface, they compile to the same bytecode: if you look
at it that way you MIGHT just find some discernable similarities.

To set up, install Android Studio:
  <https://developer.android.com/studio>
It may tell you to install a lot of things, but most things should
fall into place after that.  I don't know much beyond that though.
I am learning how Android Studio works too...

If Android Studio may be too power-hungry, try turning on
File > Power Save mode, and restart at File > Invalidate Caches.
